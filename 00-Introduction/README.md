# Introduction to Model Context Protocol (MCP)

## Overview

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standardized interface that enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to interact seamlessly with external tools, data sources, and services. This lesson provides an introduction to MCP, its purpose, and its significance in the modern AI ecosystem.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will:
- Understand what MCP is and why it was developed
- Recognize the importance of standardizing AI model interactions
- Identify real-world applications and benefits of MCP
- Have a high-level understanding of the MCP architecture

## What is the Model Context Protocol?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that defines how AI models, particularly LLMs, can interact with external systems in a structured, consistent way. It creates a standardized interface that allows models to:

1. Access external data sources
2. Use tools and execute functions
3. Interact with various services and APIs
4. Maintain conversational context across interactions

At its core, MCP addresses a fundamental challenge in AI applications: how to extend an AI model's capabilities beyond its training data by giving it access to up-to-date information and functional tools.

## Why MCP Matters

### Standardization Benefits

- **Interoperability**: Models and tools from different vendors can work together seamlessly
- **Consistency**: Developers can rely on predictable behavior across different implementations
- **Reusability**: Components built for one MCP system can be reused in others
- **Reduced Development Time**: Standard interfaces eliminate the need to create custom integrations

### The Problem MCP Solves

Before MCP, integrating AI models with external tools required custom, often brittle solutions:
- Each model vendor had different approaches to tool integration
- Custom code was needed for each model-tool combination
- Changes to models or tools often broke integrations
- Scaling to multiple tools was challenging

## MCP Architecture: A High-Level View

MCP follows a client-server architecture with these key components:

1. **MCP Host**: The environment running an AI model
2. **MCP Client**: The application requesting capabilities from the model
3. **MCP Server**: The service that provides tools and data to the model
4. **Tools**: Functions that enable specific capabilities (e.g., web search, calculation)
5. **Data Sources**: External information that the model can access

## Code Examples: Basic MCP Concepts

### .NET Example: Simple MCP Client
Reference https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/csharp-sdk

```csharp
using Microsoft.Mcp.Client;

public class SimpleMcpExample
{
    public async Task RunExample()
    {
        // Create an MCP client
        var client = new McpClient("https://mcp-server-url.com");
        
        // Define a simple prompt
        string prompt = "What's the weather in Seattle right now?";
        
        // Send request to MCP server
        var response = await client.SendPromptAsync(prompt, 
            new McpToolOptions { AllowedTools = ["weatherTool"] });
            
        // Display the response
        Console.WriteLine(response.GeneratedText);
    }
}
```

### Java Example: Basic MCP Connection
Reference https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/java-sdk 

```java
import com.mcp.client.McpClient;
import com.mcp.models.McpRequest;
import com.mcp.models.McpResponse;

public class McpIntroduction {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Initialize MCP client
        McpClient client = new McpClient.Builder()
            .setServerUrl("https://mcp-server-example.com")
            .build();
            
        // Create request
        McpRequest request = new McpRequest.Builder()
            .setPrompt("What's the weather in Seattle right now?")
            .addTool("weatherTool")
            .build();
            
        // Send request and get response
        McpResponse response = client.sendRequest(request);
        
        // Process response
        System.out.println("Model response: " + response.getGeneratedText());
    }
}
```

### Python Example: Simple MCP Integration
Reference https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk


```python
from mcp_client import McpClient

# Initialize the MCP client
client = McpClient(server_url="https://mcp-server.example.com")

# Define a prompt that might need external tools
prompt = "What's the weather in Seattle right now?"

# Send the request to the MCP server
response = client.send_prompt(
    prompt=prompt,
    allowed_tools=["weatherTool"]
)

# Process the response
print(f"Model response: {response.generated_text}")

# Check if any tools were used
if response.tool_calls:
    print(f"Tools used: {', '.join(t.tool_name for t in response.tool_calls)}")
```

## Real-World Applications

MCP enables a wide range of applications by extending AI capabilities:

1. **Enterprise Data Integration**: Connect AI models to company databases, knowledge bases, and internal tools
2. **Multi-Modal Systems**: Combine text, image, and audio processing in cohesive applications
3. **Agent Systems**: Create AI agents that can take actions in the world through API calls
4. **Augmented Generation**: Enhance AI outputs with real-time data and specialized tools

## Practical Benefits of MCP

- **Freshness**: Models can access up-to-date information beyond their training data
- **Capability Extension**: Models can leverage specialized tools for tasks they weren't trained for
- **Reduced Hallucinations**: External data sources provide factual grounding
- **Privacy**: Sensitive data can stay within secure environments instead of being embedded in prompts

## Key Takeaways

- MCP provides a standardized way for AI models to interact with external systems
- It solves integration challenges through a consistent, reusable interface
- The client-server architecture enables flexible, extensible AI applications
- MCP helps reduce development time, improve reliability, and extend model capabilities

## Exercise

Think about an AI application you're interested in building. What external tools or data sources would make this application more powerful? How might MCP help you integrate these capabilities?
