## Case Study 6: NLWeb  
MCP (Model Context Protocol) is an emerging protocol for Chatbots and AI assistants to interact with tools. Every NLWeb instance is also an MCP server, supporting one core method, ask, which lets you ask a website a question in natural language. The response uses schema.org, a widely-used vocabulary for describing web data. Loosely put, MCP is to NLWeb what HTTP is to HTML. NLWeb combines protocols, Schema.org formats, and sample code to help sites quickly create these endpoints, benefiting humans through conversational interfaces and machines through natural agent-to-agent interaction.

NLWeb consists of two main components:  
- A simple protocol to interface with a site using natural language, returning answers formatted with JSON and schema.org. See the REST API documentation for details.  
- A straightforward implementation of this protocol that leverages existing markup for sites structured as lists of items (products, recipes, attractions, reviews, etc.). Combined with UI widgets, sites can easily offer conversational interfaces to their content. See the Life of a chat query documentation for more information.
