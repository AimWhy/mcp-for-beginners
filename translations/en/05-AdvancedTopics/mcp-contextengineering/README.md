# Context Engineering: An Emerging Concept in the MCP Ecosystem

## Overview

Context engineering is a new concept in the AI field that looks at how information is structured, delivered, and maintained during interactions between clients and AI services. As the Model Context Protocol (MCP) ecosystem grows, knowing how to manage context effectively becomes increasingly important. This module introduces context engineering and explores its potential uses in MCP implementations.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Understand the emerging idea of context engineering and its possible role in MCP applications
- Identify key challenges in managing context that the MCP protocol addresses
- Explore techniques to improve model performance through better context handling
- Consider ways to measure and evaluate the effectiveness of context
- Apply these new concepts to enhance AI experiences using the MCP framework

## Introduction to Context Engineering

Context engineering is a developing concept focused on the intentional design and management of information flow between users, applications, and AI models. Unlike established fields like prompt engineering, context engineering is still being shaped by practitioners working to solve the unique challenges of providing AI models with the right information at the right time.

As large language models (LLMs) have advanced, the importance of context has become clearer. The quality, relevance, and structure of the context we provide directly affect model outputs. Context engineering studies this relationship and aims to develop principles for effective context management.

> "In 2025, the models out there are extremely intelligent. But even the smartest human won't be able to do their job effectively without the context of what they're being asked to do... 'Context engineering' is the next level of prompt engineering. It is about doing this automatically in a dynamic system." â€” Walden Yan, Cognition AI

Context engineering may include:

1. **Context Selection**: Deciding what information is relevant for a specific task  
2. **Context Structuring**: Organizing information to maximize model understanding  
3. **Context Delivery**: Optimizing how and when information is sent to models  
4. **Context Maintenance**: Managing the state and evolution of context over time  
5. **Context Evaluation**: Measuring and improving how effective the context is  

These focus areas are especially relevant to the MCP ecosystem, which offers a standardized way for applications to provide context to LLMs.

## The Context Journey Perspective

One way to visualize context engineering is to follow the path information takes through an MCP system:

    B --> C[Model Processing]
    C --> D[Response Generation]
    D --> E[State Management]
    E -->|Next Interaction| A
    
    style A fill:#A8D5BA,stroke:#000000,stroke-width:2px,color:#000000,font-weight:bold
    style B fill:#7FB3D5,stroke:#000000,stroke-width:2px,color:#000000,font-weight:bold
    style C fill:#F5CBA7,stroke:#000000,stroke-width:2px,color:#000000,font-weight:bold

    style E fill:#F9E79F,stroke:#000000,stroke-width:2px,color:#000000,font-weight:bold
```

### Key Stages in the Context Journey:

1. **User Input**: Raw data from the user (text, images, documents)  
2. **Context Assembly**: Combining user input with system context, conversation history, and other retrieved information  
3. **Model Processing**: The AI model processes the assembled context  
4. **Response Generation**: The model produces outputs based on the provided context  
5. **State Management**: The system updates its internal state based on the interaction  

This view highlights the dynamic nature of context in AI systems and raises important questions about how to best manage information at each stage.

## Emerging Principles in Context Engineering

As context engineering develops, some early principles are emerging from practitioners. These principles may help guide MCP implementation decisions:

### Principle 1: Share Context Completely

Context should be shared fully between all parts of a system rather than split across multiple agents or processes. When context is fragmented, decisions made in one part of the system may conflict with those made elsewhere.

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Fragmented Context Approach"
    A1[Agent 1] --- C1[Context 1]
    A2[Agent 2] --- C2[Context 2]
    A3[Agent 3] --- C3[Context 3]
    end
    
    subgraph "Unified Context Approach"
    B1[Agent] --- D1[Shared Complete Context]
    end
    
    style A1 fill:#AED6F1,stroke:#000000,stroke-width:2px,color:#000000,font-weight:bold
    style A2 fill:#AED6F1,stroke:#000000,stroke-width:2px,color:#000000,font-weight:bold
    style A3 fill:#AED6F1,stroke:#000000,stroke-width:2px,color:#000000,font-weight:bold
    style B1 fill:#A9DFBF,stroke:#000000,stroke-width:2px,color:#000000,font-weight:bold
    style C1 fill:#F5B7B1,stroke:#000000,stroke-width:2px,color:#000000,font-weight:bold
    style C2 fill:#F5B7B1,stroke:#000000,stroke-width:2px,color:#000000,font-weight:bold
    style C3 fill:#F5B7B1,stroke:#000000,stroke-width:2px,color:#000000,font-weight:bold
    style D1 fill:#D7BDE2,stroke:#000000,stroke-width:2px,color:#000000,font-weight:bold
```

In MCP applications, this means designing systems where context flows smoothly through the entire pipeline instead of being compartmentalized.

### Principle 2: Recognize That Actions Carry Implicit Decisions

Every action a model takes includes implicit decisions about how to interpret the context. When multiple components act on different contexts, these implicit decisions can conflict, causing inconsistent results.

This principle has important implications for MCP applications:  
- Prefer linear processing of complex tasks over parallel execution with fragmented context  
- Ensure all decision points have access to the same contextual information  
- Design systems so later steps can see the full context of earlier decisions  

### Principle 3: Balance Context Depth with Window Limitations

As conversations and processes get longer, context windows eventually overflow. Effective context engineering explores ways to manage the tension between providing comprehensive context and dealing with technical limits.

Possible approaches include:  
- Context compression that keeps essential information while reducing token use  
- Progressive loading of context based on relevance to current needs  
- Summarizing previous interactions while preserving key decisions and facts  

## Context Challenges and MCP Protocol Design

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) was created with an understanding of the unique challenges in managing context. Knowing these challenges helps explain key parts of the MCP protocol design:

### Challenge 1: Context Window Limitations  
Most AI models have fixed context window sizes, limiting how much information they can process at once.

**MCP Design Response:**  
- The protocol supports structured, resource-based context that can be referenced efficiently  
- Resources can be paginated and loaded progressively  

### Challenge 2: Relevance Determination  
Figuring out which information is most relevant to include in context is difficult.

**MCP Design Response:**  
- Flexible tools allow dynamic retrieval of information based on need  
- Structured prompts enable consistent context organization  

### Challenge 3: Context Persistence  
Managing state across interactions requires careful tracking of context.

**MCP Design Response:**  
- Standardized session management  
- Clearly defined interaction patterns for context evolution  

### Challenge 4: Multi-Modal Context  
Different types of data (text, images, structured data) require different handling.

**MCP Design Response:**  
- Protocol design supports various content types  
- Standardized representation of multi-modal information  

### Challenge 5: Security and Privacy  
Context often contains sensitive information that must be protected.

**MCP Design Response:**  
- Clear boundaries between client and server responsibilities  
- Local processing options to minimize data exposure  

Understanding these challenges and how MCP addresses them provides a foundation for exploring more advanced context engineering techniques.

## Emerging Context Engineering Approaches

As context engineering evolves, several promising approaches are emerging. These represent current thinking rather than established best practices and will likely change as we gain more experience with MCP implementations.

### 1. Single-Threaded Linear Processing

Unlike multi-agent architectures that split context, some practitioners find that single-threaded linear processing produces more consistent results. This aligns with the principle of maintaining unified context.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Task Start] --> B[Process Step 1]
    B --> C[Process Step 2]
    C --> D[Process Step 3]
    D --> E[Result]
    
    style A fill:#A9CCE3,stroke:#000000,stroke-width:2px,color:#000000,font-weight:bold
    style B fill:#A3E4D7,stroke:#000000,stroke-width:2px,color:#000000,font-weight:bold
    style C fill:#F9E79F,stroke:#000000,stroke-width:2px,color:#000000,font-weight:bold
    style D fill:#F5CBA7,stroke:#000000,stroke-width:2px,color:#000000,font-weight:bold
    style E fill:#D2B4DE,stroke:#000000,stroke-width:2px,color:#000000,font-weight:bold
```

While this approach may seem less efficient than parallel processing, it often yields more coherent and reliable results because each step builds on a complete understanding of previous decisions.

### 2. Context Chunking and Prioritization

Breaking large contexts into manageable pieces and prioritizing the most important parts.

```python
# Conceptual Example: Context Chunking and Prioritization
def process_with_chunked_context(documents, query):
    # 1. Break documents into smaller chunks
    chunks = chunk_documents(documents)
    
    # 2. Calculate relevance scores for each chunk
    scored_chunks = [(chunk, calculate_relevance(chunk, query)) for chunk in chunks]
    
    # 3. Sort chunks by relevance score
    sorted_chunks = sorted(scored_chunks, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
    
    # 4. Use the most relevant chunks as context
    context = create_context_from_chunks([chunk for chunk, score in sorted_chunks[:5]])
    
    # 5. Process with the prioritized context
    return generate_response(context, query)
```

The example above shows how large documents might be broken into smaller pieces and only the most relevant parts selected for context. This helps work within context window limits while still using large knowledge bases.

### 3. Progressive Context Loading

Loading context progressively as needed instead of all at once.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant App
    participant MCP Server
    participant AI Model

    User->>App: Ask Question
    App->>MCP Server: Initial Request
    MCP Server->>AI Model: Minimal Context
    AI Model->>MCP Server: Initial Response
    
    alt Needs More Context
        MCP Server->>MCP Server: Identify Missing Context
        MCP Server->>MCP Server: Load Additional Context
        MCP Server->>AI Model: Enhanced Context
        AI Model->>MCP Server: Final Response
    end
    
    MCP Server->>App: Response
    App->>User: Answer
```

Progressive context loading starts with minimal context and expands only when necessary. This can greatly reduce token use for simple queries while still handling complex questions.

### 4. Context Compression and Summarization

Reducing context size while keeping essential information.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Full Context] --> B[Compression Model]
    B --> C[Compressed Context]
    C --> D[Main Processing Model]
    D --> E[Response]
    
    style A fill:#A9CCE3,stroke:#000000,stroke-width:2px,color:#000000,font-weight:bold
    style B fill:#A3E4D7,stroke:#000000,stroke-width:2px,color:#000000,font-weight:bold
    style C fill:#F5CBA7,stroke:#000000,stroke-width:2px,color:#000000,font-weight:bold
    style D fill:#D2B4DE,stroke:#000000,stroke-width:2px,color:#000000,font-weight:bold
    style E fill:#F9E79F,stroke:#000000,stroke-width:2px,color:#000000,font-weight:bold
```

Context compression focuses on:  
- Removing redundant information  
- Summarizing lengthy content  
- Extracting key facts and details  
- Preserving critical context elements  
- Optimizing token efficiency  

This approach is especially useful for maintaining long conversations within context windows or processing large documents efficiently. Some practitioners use specialized models specifically for compressing and summarizing conversation history.

## Exploratory Context Engineering Considerations

As we explore context engineering, several considerations are worth keeping in mind when working with MCP implementations. These are not strict best practices but areas to explore that may improve your specific use case.

### Consider Your Context Goals

Before implementing complex context management, clearly define what you want to achieve:  
- What specific information does the model need to succeed?  
- Which information is essential versus supplementary?  
- What are your performance constraints (latency, token limits, costs)?  

### Explore Layered Context Approaches

Some practitioners find success arranging context in conceptual layers:  
- **Core Layer**: Essential information the model always needs  
- **Situational Layer**: Context specific to the current interaction  
- **Supporting Layer**: Additional information that might help  
- **Fallback Layer**: Information accessed only when needed  

### Investigate Retrieval Strategies

How you retrieve information often affects context effectiveness:  
- Semantic search and embeddings to find conceptually relevant info  
- Keyword-based search for specific factual details  
- Hybrid methods combining multiple retrieval techniques  
- Metadata filtering to narrow scope by categories, dates, or sources  

### Experiment with Context Coherence

The structure and flow of your context can impact model understanding:  
- Group related information together  
- Use consistent formatting and organization  
- Maintain logical or chronological order when appropriate  
- Avoid contradictory information  

### Weigh the Tradeoffs of Multi-Agent Architectures

While multi-agent architectures are popular in many AI frameworks, they pose significant challenges for context management:  
- Fragmented context can cause inconsistent decisions across agents  
- Parallel processing may introduce conflicts that are hard to resolve  
- Communication overhead between agents can reduce performance gains  
- Complex state management is needed to keep coherence  

Often, a single-agent approach with comprehensive context management produces more reliable results than multiple specialized agents with fragmented context.

### Develop Evaluation Methods

To improve context engineering over time, consider how you will measure success:  
- A/B testing different context structures  
- Monitoring token usage and response times  
- Tracking user satisfaction and task completion rates  
- Analyzing when and why context strategies fail  

These considerations represent active areas of exploration in context engineering. As the field matures, clearer patterns and practices will likely emerge.

## Measuring Context Effectiveness: An Evolving Framework

As context engineering develops, practitioners are starting to explore how to measure its effectiveness. No established framework exists yet, but various metrics are being considered to guide future work.

### Potential Measurement Dimensions

#### 1. Input Efficiency Considerations

- **Context-to-Response Ratio**: How much context is needed compared to the response size?  
- **Token Utilization**: What percentage of context tokens actually influence the response?  
- **Context Reduction**: How effectively can raw information be compressed?  

#### 2. Performance Considerations

- **Latency Impact**: How does context management affect response time?  
- **Token Economy**: Are tokens being used efficiently?  
- **Retrieval Precision**: How relevant is the retrieved information?  
- **Resource Utilization**: What computational resources are required?  

#### 3. Quality Considerations

- **Response Relevance**: How well does the response address the query?  
- **Factual Accuracy**: Does context management improve factual correctness?  
- **Consistency**: Are responses consistent across similar queries?  
- **Hallucination Rate**: Does better context reduce model hallucinations?  

#### 4. User Experience Considerations

- **Follow-up Rate**: How often do users need clarification?  
- **Task Completion**: Do users successfully complete their goals?  
- **Satisfaction Indicators**: How do users rate their experience?  

### Exploratory Approaches to Measurement

When experimenting with context engineering in MCP implementations, consider these approaches:  

1. **Baseline Comparisons**: Start with simple context methods before testing more advanced ones  
2. **Incremental Changes**: Change one aspect of context management at a time to isolate effects  
3. **User-Centered Evaluation**: Combine quantitative metrics with qualitative user feedback  
4. **Failure Analysis**: Study cases where context strategies fail to find improvements  
5. **Multi-Dimensional Assessment**: Balance efficiency, quality, and user experience trade-offs  

This experimental, multi-faceted approach fits the emerging nature of context engineering.

## Closing Thoughts

Context engineering is a new area that could be key to effective MCP applications. By carefully considering how information flows through your system, you can create AI experiences that are more efficient, accurate, and valuable to users.

The techniques and approaches in this module represent early thinking, not established practices. Context engineering may become a more defined discipline as AI capabilities grow and our understanding deepens. For now, experimentation combined with careful measurement seems the best path forward.

## Potential Future Directions

Context engineering is still in its early days, but several promising directions are emerging:

- Context engineering principles may greatly impact model performance, efficiency, user experience, and reliability  
- Single-threaded approaches with comprehensive context management may outperform multi-agent architectures in many cases  
- Specialized context compression models may become standard parts of AI pipelines  
- The balance between context completeness and token limits will likely drive innovation in context handling  
- As models improve at efficient, human-like communication, true multi-agent collaboration may become more practical  
- MCP implementations may evolve to standardize context management patterns emerging from current experiments
