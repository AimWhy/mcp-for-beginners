## Deterministic Sampling

For applications that require consistent outputs, deterministic sampling guarantees reproducible results. It achieves this by using a fixed random seed and setting the temperature to zero.

Let's review the sample implementation below to demonstrate deterministic sampling in various programming languages.

## Dynamic Sampling Configuration

Smart sampling adjusts parameters based on the context and specific needs of each request. This means dynamically tuning parameters like temperature, top_p, and penalties depending on the task type, user preferences, or past performance.

Let's see how to implement dynamic sampling in different programming languages.
