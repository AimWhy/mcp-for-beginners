## Example: Root Context Implementation for financial analysis

In this example, we will set up a root context for a financial analysis session, showing how to maintain state across multiple interactions.

## Example: Root Context Management

Effectively managing root contexts is essential for preserving conversation history and state. Hereâ€™s an example of how to implement root context management.

## Root Context for Multi-Turn Assistance

In this example, we will create a root context for a multi-turn assistance session, illustrating how to maintain state throughout several interactions.

## Root Context Best Practices

Here are some best practices for managing root contexts effectively:

- **Create Focused Contexts**: Establish separate root contexts for different conversation topics or domains to keep things clear.

- **Set Expiration Policies**: Apply policies to archive or delete old contexts to manage storage and comply with data retention rules.

- **Store Relevant Metadata**: Use context metadata to save important information about the conversation that could be useful later.

- **Use Context IDs Consistently**: After creating a context, consistently use its ID for all related requests to maintain continuity.

- **Generate Summaries**: When a context becomes large, consider creating summaries to capture key information while controlling context size.

- **Implement Access Control**: For multi-user systems, set up proper access controls to protect the privacy and security of conversation contexts.

- **Handle Context Limitations**: Be mindful of context size limits and develop strategies to manage very long conversations.

- **Archive When Complete**: Archive contexts once conversations are finished to free up resources while preserving conversation history.
