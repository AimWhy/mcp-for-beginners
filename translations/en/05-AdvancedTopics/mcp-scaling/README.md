## Vertical Scaling and Resource Optimization

Vertical scaling focuses on optimizing a single MCP server instance to handle more requests efficiently. This can be done by fine-tuning configurations, using efficient algorithms, and managing resources effectively. For example, you can adjust thread pools, request timeouts, and memory limits to boost performance.

Let's look at an example of how to optimize an MCP server for vertical scaling and resource management.

## Distributed Architecture

Distributed architectures involve multiple MCP nodes working together to handle requests, share resources, and provide redundancy. This approach improves scalability and fault tolerance by enabling nodes to communicate and coordinate through a distributed system.

Let's look at an example of how to implement a distributed MCP server architecture using Redis for coordination.
