## Vertical Scaling and Resource Optimization

Vertical scaling focuses on enhancing a single MCP server instance to efficiently manage more requests. This can be done by fine-tuning settings, applying efficient algorithms, and effectively managing resources. For example, you might adjust thread pools, request timeouts, and memory limits to boost performance.

Let's explore an example of how to optimize an MCP server for vertical scaling and resource management.

## Distributed Architecture

Distributed architectures involve multiple MCP nodes collaborating to handle requests, share resources, and ensure redundancy. This setup improves scalability and fault tolerance by enabling nodes to communicate and coordinate through a distributed system.

Let's examine an example of implementing a distributed MCP server architecture using Redis for coordination.
