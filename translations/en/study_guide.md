# Model Context Protocol (MCP) for Beginners - Study Guide

This study guide offers an overview of the repository structure and content for the "Model Context Protocol (MCP) for Beginners" curriculum. Use it to navigate the repository efficiently and make the most of the available resources.

## Repository Overview

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standardized framework for interactions between AI models and client applications. Originally developed by Anthropic, MCP is now maintained by the wider MCP community through the official GitHub organization. This repository provides a comprehensive curriculum with hands-on code examples in C#, Java, JavaScript, Python, and TypeScript, designed for AI developers, system architects, and software engineers.
