## Key Takeaways

Integrating documentation directly into your tools is more than just convenientâ€”it transforms productivity. By connecting your client to the Microsoft Learn Docs MCP server, you can:

- Avoid constantly switching between your code and documentation
- Access up-to-date, context-aware documentation in real time
- Build smarter, more interactive developer tools

These skills will enable you to create solutions that are not only efficient but also enjoyable to use.
