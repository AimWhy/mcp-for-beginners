## Getting Started  

This section includes several lessons:

- **-1- Your first server**: In this first lesson, you'll learn how to create your first server and inspect it using the inspector tool, a valuable way to test and debug your server, [to the lesson](/03-GettingStarted/01-first-server/README.md)

- **-2- Client**: In this lesson, you'll learn how to write a client that can connect to your server, [to the lesson](/03-GettingStarted/02-client/README.md)

- **-3- Client with LLM**: An even better way to write a client is by adding an LLM so it can "negotiate" with your server on what to do, [to the lesson](/03-GettingStarted/03-llm-client/README.md)

- **-4- Consuming a server GitHub Copilot Agent mode in Visual Studio Code**: Here, we explore running our MCP Server from within Visual Studio Code, [to the lesson](/03-GettingStarted/04-vscode/README.md)

- **-5- Consuming from a SSE (Server Sent Events)**: SSE is a standard for server-to-client streaming, allowing servers to push real-time updates to clients over HTTP, [to the lesson](/03-GettingStarted/05-sse-server/README.md)

- **-6- Utilizing AI Toolkit for VSCode**: To consume and test your MCP Clients and Servers, [to the lesson](/03-GettingStarted/06-aitk/README.md)

- **-7 Testing**: Here we focus especially on how to test our server and client in different ways, [to the lesson](/03-GettingStarted/07-testing/README.md)

- **-8- Deployment**: This chapter covers different ways to deploy your MCP solutions, [to the lesson](/03-GettingStarted/08-deployment/README.md)


The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs. Think of MCP like a USB-C port for AI applications â€“ it offers a standardized way to connect AI models to various data sources and tools.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Set up development environments for MCP in C#, Java, Python, TypeScript, and JavaScript
- Build and deploy basic MCP servers with custom features (resources, prompts, and tools)
- Create host applications that connect to MCP servers
- Test and debug MCP implementations
- Understand common setup challenges and how to solve them
- Connect your MCP implementations to popular LLM services

## Setting Up Your MCP Environment

Before you start working with MCP, it's important to prepare your development environment and understand the basic workflow. This section will guide you through the initial setup steps to ensure a smooth start with MCP.

### Prerequisites

Before diving into MCP development, make sure you have:

- **Development Environment**: For your chosen language (C#, Java, Python, TypeScript, or JavaScript)
- **IDE/Editor**: Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ, Eclipse, PyCharm, or any modern code editor
- **Package Managers**: NuGet, Maven/Gradle, pip, or npm/yarn
- **API Keys**: For any AI services you plan to use in your host applications


### Official SDKs

In the upcoming chapters, you will see solutions built using Python, TypeScript, Java, and .NET. Here are all the officially supported SDKs.

MCP offers official SDKs for multiple languages:
- [C# SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/csharp-sdk) - Maintained in collaboration with Microsoft
- [Java SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/java-sdk) - Maintained in collaboration with Spring AI
- [TypeScript SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk) - The official TypeScript implementation
- [Python SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk) - The official Python implementation
- [Kotlin SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/kotlin-sdk) - The official Kotlin implementation
- [Swift SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/swift-sdk) - Maintained in collaboration with Loopwork AI
- [Rust SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/rust-sdk) - The official Rust implementation

## Key Takeaways

- Setting up an MCP development environment is straightforward with language-specific SDKs
- Building MCP servers involves creating and registering tools with clear schemas
- MCP clients connect to servers and models to leverage extended capabilities
- Testing and debugging are essential for reliable MCP implementations
- Deployment options range from local development to cloud-based solutions
