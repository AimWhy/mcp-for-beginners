### -2- Create project

Now that you have your SDK installed, let's move on to creating a project:

### -3- Create project files

### -4- Create server code

### -5- Adding a tool and a resource

Add a tool and a resource by including the following code:

### -6 Final code

Let's add the final code needed to start the server:

### -7- Test the server

Start the server with the following command:

### -8- Run using the inspector

The inspector is a great tool that can launch your server and allow you to interact with it so you can verify that it works. Let's get it started:
> [!NOTE]  
> it might look different in the "command" field as it contains the command for running a server with your specific runtime/
You should see the following user interface:

![Connect](/03-GettingStarted/01-first-server/assets/connect.png)

1. Connect to the server by selecting the Connect button  
   Once connected to the server, you should see the following:

   ![Connected](/03-GettingStarted/01-first-server/assets/connected.png)

1. Select "Tools" and then "listTools". You should see "Add" appear. Select "Add" and fill in the parameter values.

   You should see the following response, which is the result from the "add" tool:

   ![Result of running add](/03-GettingStarted/01-first-server/assets/ran-tool.png)

Congratulations, youâ€™ve successfully created and run your first server!

### Official SDKs

MCP offers official SDKs for multiple languages:

- [C# SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/csharp-sdk) - Maintained in collaboration with Microsoft
- [Java SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/java-sdk) - Maintained in collaboration with Spring AI
- [TypeScript SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk) - The official TypeScript implementation
- [Python SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk) - The official Python implementation
- [Kotlin SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/kotlin-sdk) - The official Kotlin implementation
- [Swift SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/swift-sdk) - Maintained in collaboration with Loopwork AI
- [Rust SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/rust-sdk) - The official Rust implementation

## Key Takeaways

- Setting up an MCP development environment is simple with language-specific SDKs  
- Building MCP servers involves creating and registering tools with well-defined schemas  
- Testing and debugging are crucial for reliable MCP implementations

## Assignment

Create a simple MCP server with a tool of your choice:

1. Implement the tool in your preferred language (.NET, Java, Python, or JavaScript).  
2. Define input parameters and return values.  
3. Run the inspector tool to verify the server works as expected.  
4. Test the implementation with various inputs.
