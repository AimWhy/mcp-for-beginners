Great, for our next step, let's list the capabilities on the server.

### -2 List server capabilities

Now we will connect to the server and ask for its capabilities:

### -3- Convert server capabilities to LLM tools

The next step after listing server capabilities is to convert them into a format that the LLM understands. Once we do that, we can provide these capabilities as tools to our LLM.

Great, we're now set up to handle user requests, so let's move on to that.

### -4- Handle user prompt request

In this part of the code, we will manage user requests.

Great, you did it!

## Assignment

Take the code from the exercise and expand the server by adding more tools. Then create a client with an LLM, like in the exercise, and test it with different prompts to ensure all your server tools are called dynamically. This approach to building a client ensures the end user has a great experience, as they can use natural language prompts instead of exact client commands and wonâ€™t need to know about any MCP server being called.

## Solution 

[Solution](/03-GettingStarted/03-llm-client/solution/README.md)

## Key Takeaways

- Adding an LLM to your client offers a better way for users to interact with MCP Servers.
- You need to convert the MCP Server response into a format the LLM can understand.
