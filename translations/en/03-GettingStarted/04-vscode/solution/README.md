This corresponds to running a command like this: `node build/index.js`.

- Change this server entry to fit where your server file is located or to what's needed to startup your server depending on your chosen runtime and server location.

## Consume the features in the server

- Click the `play` icon, once you've added *mcp.json* to *./vscode* folder,

    Observe the tooling icon change to increase the number of available tools. Tooling icon is located right above the chat field in GitHub Copilot.

## Run a tool

- Type a prompt in your chat window that matches the description of your tool. For example to trigger the tool `add` and then typing something like "add 3 to 20".

You should see a tool appear above the chat text box prompting you to select it to run the tool, as shown in this image:

Selecting the tool should produce a numeric result showing "23" if your prompt was as we described earlier.
