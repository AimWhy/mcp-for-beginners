# SSE Server

SSE (Server Sent Events) is a standard for server-to-client streaming, allowing servers to push real-time updates to clients over HTTP. This is especially useful for applications that need live updates, such as chat apps, notifications, or real-time data feeds. Also, your server can be accessed by multiple clients simultaneously since it runs on a server that can be hosted anywhere, like in the cloud.

## Overview

This lesson explains how to build and use SSE Servers.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Build an SSE Server.
- Debug an SSE Server using the Inspector.
- Use an SSE Server with Visual Studio Code.

## SSE, how it works

SSE is one of two supported transport types. Youâ€™ve already seen the first one, stdio, used in previous lessons. The difference is:

- SSE requires you to manage two things: connections and messages.
- Since this server can run anywhere, you need to adjust how you work with tools like the Inspector and Visual Studio Code. Instead of specifying how to start the server, you point to the endpoint where the connection is established. See the example code below:

### TypeScript

```typescript
app.get("/sse", async (_: Request, res: Response) => {
    const transport = new SSEServerTransport('/messages', res);
    transports[transport.sessionId] = transport;
    res.on("close", () => {
        delete transports[transport.sessionId];
    });
    await server.connect(transport);
});

app.post("/messages", async (req: Request, res: Response) => {
    const sessionId = req.query.sessionId as string;
    const transport = transports[sessionId];
    if (transport) {
        await transport.handlePostMessage(req, res);
    } else {
        res.status(400).send('No transport found for sessionId');
    }
});
```

In the code above:

- `/sse` is set up as a route. When a request hits this route, a new transport instance is created and the server *connects* using this transport.
- `/messages` is the route that handles incoming messages.

### Python

```python
mcp = FastMCP("My App")

@mcp.tool()
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """Add two numbers"""
    return a + b

# Mount the SSE server to the existing ASGI server
app = Starlette(
    routes=[
        Mount('/', app=mcp.sse_app()),
    ]
)

```

In this code:

- We create an instance of an ASGI server (using Starlette specifically) and mount the default route `/`.

  Behind the scenes, the routes `/sse` and `/messages` are configured to handle connections and messages respectively. The rest of the app, like adding features such as tools, works the same way as with stdio servers.

### .NET    

```csharp
    var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
    builder.Services
        .AddMcpServer()
        .WithTools<Tools>();


    builder.Services.AddHttpClient();

    var app = builder.Build();

    app.MapMcp();
    ```

There are two methods that help transform a web server into one that supports SSE:

- `AddMcpServer` adds the necessary capabilities.
- `MapMcp` adds routes like `/SSE` and `/messages`.

```

Now that we know a little bit more about SSE, let's build an SSE server next.

## Exercise: Creating an SSE Server

To create our server, we need to keep two things in mind:

- We need to use a web server to expose endpoints for connection and messages.
- Build our server like we normally do with tools, resources and prompts when we were using stdio.

### -1- Create a server instance

To create our server, we use the same types as with stdio. However, for the transport, we need to choose SSE.

### TypeScript

```typescript
import { Request, Response } from "express";
import express from "express";
import { McpServer } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/mcp.js";
import { SSEServerTransport } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/sse.js";

const server = new McpServer({
  name: "example-server",
  version: "1.0.0"
});

const app = express();

const transports: {[sessionId: string]: SSEServerTransport} = {};
```

In the preceding code we've:

- Created a server instance.
- Defined an app using the web framework express.
- Created a transports variable that we will use to store incoming connections.

### Python

```python
from starlette.applications import Starlette
from starlette.routing import Mount, Host
from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP


mcp = FastMCP("My App")
```

In the preceding code we've:

- Imported the libraries we're going to need with Starlette (an ASGI framework) being pulled in.
- Created an MCP server instance `mcp`.

### .NET

```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
builder.Services
    .AddMcpServer();


builder.Services.AddHttpClient();

var app = builder.Build();

// TODO: add routes 
```

At this point, we've:

- Created a web app
- Added support for MCP features through `AddMcpServer`.

Let's add the needed routes next.

### -2- Add routes

Let's add routes next that handle the connection and incoming messages:

### TypeScript

```typescript
app.get("/sse", async (_: Request, res: Response) => {
  const transport = new SSEServerTransport('/messages', res);
  transports[transport.sessionId] = transport;
  res.on("close", () => {
    delete transports[transport.sessionId];
  });
  await server.connect(transport);
});

app.post("/messages", async (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  const sessionId = req.query.sessionId as string;
  const transport = transports[sessionId];
  if (transport) {
    await transport.handlePostMessage(req, res);
  } else {
    res.status(400).send('No transport found for sessionId');
  }
});

app.listen(3001);
```

In the preceding code we've defined:

- An `/sse` route that instantiates a transport of type SSE and ends up calling `connect` on the MCP server.
- A `/messages` route that takes care of incoming messages.

### Python

```python
app = Starlette(
    routes=[
        Mount('/', app=mcp.sse_app()),
    ]
)
```

In the preceding code we've:

- Created an ASGI app instance using the Starlette framework. As part of that we passes `mcp.sse_app()` to it's list of routes. That ends up mounting an `/sse` and `/messages` route on the app instance.

### .NET

```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
builder.Services
    .AddMcpServer();

builder.Services.AddHttpClient();

var app = builder.Build();

app.MapMcp();
```

We've added one line of code at the end `add.MapMcp()` this means we now have routes `/SSE` and `/messages`. 

Let's add capabilties to the server next.

### -3- Adding server capabilities

Now that we've got everything SSE specific defined, let's add server capabilities like tools, prompts and resources.

### TypeScript

```typescript
server.tool("random-joke", "A joke returned by the chuck norris api", {},
  async () => {
    const response = await fetch("https://api.chucknorris.io/jokes/random");
    const data = await response.json();

    return {
      content: [
        {
          type: "text",
          text: data.value
        }
      ]
    };
  }
);
```

Here's how you can add a tool for example. This specific tool creates a tool call "random-joke" that calls a Chuck Norris API and returns a JSON response.

### Python

```python
@mcp.tool()
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """Add two numbers"""
    return a + b
```

Now your server has one tool.

### TypeScript

```typescript
// server-sse.ts
import { Request, Response } from "express";
import express from "express";
import { McpServer } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/mcp.js";
import { SSEServerTransport } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/sse.js";

// Create an MCP server
const server = new McpServer({
  name: "example-server",
  version: "1.0.0",
});

const app = express();

const transports: { [sessionId: string]: SSEServerTransport } = {};

app.get("/sse", async (_: Request, res: Response) => {
  const transport = new SSEServerTransport("/messages", res);
  transports[transport.sessionId] = transport;
  res.on("close", () => {
    delete transports[transport.sessionId];
  });
  await server.connect(transport);
});

app.post("/messages", async (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  const sessionId = req.query.sessionId as string;
  const transport = transports[sessionId];
  if (transport) {
    await transport.handlePostMessage(req, res);
  } else {
    res.status(400).send("No transport found for sessionId");
  }
});

server.tool("random-joke", "A joke returned by the chuck norris api", {}, async () => {
  const response = await fetch("https://api.chucknorris.io/jokes/random");
  const data = await response.json();

  return {
    content: [
      {
        type: "text",
        text: data.value,
      },
    ],
  };
});

app.listen(3001);
```

### Python

```python
from starlette.applications import Starlette
from starlette.routing import Mount, Host
from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP


mcp = FastMCP("My App")

@mcp.tool()
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """Add two numbers"""
    return a + b

# Mount the SSE server to the existing ASGI server
app = Starlette(
    routes=[
        Mount('/', app=mcp.sse_app()),
    ]
)
```

### .NET

1. Let's create some tools first, for this we will create a file *Tools.cs* with the following content:

  ```csharp
  using System.ComponentModel;
  using System.Text.Json;
  using ModelContextProtocol.Server;

  namespace server;

  [McpServerToolType]
  public sealed class Tools
  {

      public Tools()
      {
      
      }

      [McpServerTool, Description("Add two numbers together.")]
      public async Task<string> AddNumbers(
          [Description("The first number")] int a,
          [Description("The second number")] int b)
      {
          return (a + b).ToString();
      }

  }
  ```

  Here we've added the following:

  - Created a class `Tools` with the decorator `McpServerToolType`.
  - Defined a tool `AddNumbers` by decorating the method with `McpServerTool`. We've also provided parameters and an implementation.

1. Let's leverage the `Tools` class we just created:

  ```csharp
  var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
  builder.Services
      .AddMcpServer()
      .WithTools<Tools>();


  builder.Services.AddHttpClient();

  var app = builder.Build();

  app.MapMcp();
  ```

  We've added a call to `WithTools` that specifies `Tools` as the class containing the tools. That's it, we're ready.

Great, we have a server using SSE, let's take it for a spin next.

## Exercise: Debugging an SSE Server with Inspector

Inspector is a great tool that we saw in a previous lesson [Creating your first server](/03-GettingStarted/01-first-server/README.md). Let's see if we can use the Inspector even here:

### -1- Running the inspector

To run the inspector, you first must have an SSE server running, so let's do that next:

1. Run the server 

    ### TypeScript

    ```sh
    tsx && node ./build/server-sse.ts
    ```

    ### Python

    ```sh
    uvicorn server:app
    ```

    Note how we use the executable `uvicorn` that's installed when we typed `pip install "mcp[cli]"`. Typing `server:app` means we're trying to run a file `server.py` and for it to have a Starlette instance called `app`. 

    ### .NET

    ```sh
    dotnet run
    ```

    This should start the server. To interface with it you need a new terminal.

1. Run the inspector

    > ![NOTE]
    > Run this in a separate terminal window than the server is running in. Also note, you need to adjust the below command to fit the URL where your server runs.

    ```sh
    npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector --cli http://localhost:8000/sse --method tools/list
    ```

    Running the inspector looks the same across all runtimes. Notice that instead of passing a path to start the server, you pass the URL where the server is running and specify the `/sse` route.

### -2- Trying out the tool

Connect to the server by selecting SSE in the dropdown and enter the URL where your server is running, for example http://localhost:4321/sse. Then click the "Connect" button. As before, choose to list tools, select a tool, and provide input values. You should see a result like this:

![SSE Server running in inspector](../../../../translated_images/sse-inspector.d86628cc597b8fae807a31d3d6837842f5f9ee1bcc6101013fa0c709c96029ad.en.png)

Great, you can now work with the inspector. Next, letâ€™s see how to work with Visual Studio Code.

## Assignment

Try expanding your server with more features. Check out [this page](https://api.chucknorris.io/) to, for example, add a tool that calls an API. You decide what your server should do. Have fun :)

## Solution

[Solution](./solution/README.md) Hereâ€™s one possible solution with working code.

## Key Takeaways

The main points from this chapter are:

- SSE is the second supported transport alongside stdio.
- To support SSE, you need to manage incoming connections and messages using a web framework.
- You can use both Inspector and Visual Studio Code to consume an SSE server, just like stdio servers. Note the differences: for SSE, you start the server separately and then run your inspector tool. Also, with the inspector, you need to specify the URL.
