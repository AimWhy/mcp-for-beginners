# Sample

This is a Python sample for an MCP Server.

This module demonstrates how to implement a basic MCP server that can handle completion requests. It provides a mock implementation that simulates interaction with various AI models.

Here's what the tool registration process looks like:

```python
completion_tool = ToolDefinition(
    name="completion",
    description="Generate completions using AI models",
    parameters={
        "model": {
            "type": "string",
            "enum": self.models,
            "description": "The AI model to use for completion"
        },
        "prompt": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "The prompt text to complete"
        },
        "temperature": {
            "type": "number",
            "description": "Sampling temperature (0.0 to 1.0)"
        },
        "max_tokens": {
            "type": "number",
            "description": "Maximum number of tokens to generate"
        }
    },
    required=["model", "prompt"]
)

# Register the tool with its handler
self.server.tools.register(completion_tool, self._handle_completion)
```

## Install

Run the following command:

```bash
pip install mcp
```

## Run

```bash
python mcp_sample.py
```
