## Case Study 6: NLWeb  
MCP (Model Context Protocol) is an emerging protocol for chatbots and AI assistants to interact with tools. Every NLWeb instance is also an MCP server, supporting one core method, ask, which allows querying a website in natural language. The response uses schema.org, a widely adopted vocabulary for describing web data. In simple terms, MCP is to NLWeb what HTTP is to HTML. NLWeb combines protocols, schema.org formats, and sample code to help sites quickly create these endpoints, benefiting humans through conversational interfaces and machines through natural agent-to-agent communication.

NLWeb consists of two main components:  
- A simple protocol for natural language interaction with a site and a format using JSON and schema.org for responses. See the REST API documentation for details.  
- A straightforward implementation of the above for sites that can be abstracted as lists of items (products, recipes, attractions, reviews, etc.). Together with UI widgets, sites can easily provide conversational interfaces to their content. See the Life of a chat query documentation for more details.
