## Case Study 6: NLWeb  
MCP (Model Context Protocol) is an emerging protocol that enables chatbots and AI assistants to interact with tools. Every NLWeb instance is also an MCP server, supporting one core method, ask, which allows querying a website in natural language. The returned response uses schema.org, a widely adopted vocabulary for describing web data. Loosely put, MCP is to NLWeb what HTTP is to HTML. NLWeb combines protocols, schema.org formats, and sample code to help sites quickly create these endpoints, benefiting both humans through conversational interfaces and machines through natural agent-to-agent communication.

NLWeb consists of two main components:  
- A simple protocol to interface with a site in natural language, returning answers formatted with json and schema.org. See the REST API documentation for details.  
- A straightforward implementation of this protocol that leverages existing markup for sites that can be abstracted as lists of items (products, recipes, attractions, reviews, etc.). Together with UI widgets, sites can easily offer conversational access to their content. See the Life of a chat query documentation for more information.
