## Case Study 6: NLWeb  
MCP (Model Context Protocol) is an emerging protocol that enables chatbots and AI assistants to interact with tools. Every NLWeb instance is also an MCP server, supporting one core method, ask, which lets users ask a website questions in natural language. The responses use schema.org, a widely adopted vocabulary for describing web data. In simple terms, MCP is to NLWeb what HTTP is to HTML. NLWeb combines protocols, schema.org formats, and sample code to help websites quickly create these endpoints, benefiting both humans through conversational interfaces and machines through natural agent-to-agent communication.

NLWeb consists of two main components:  
- A simple protocol to interact with a site in natural language, using JSON and schema.org for the returned answers. See the REST API documentation for more details.  
- An easy implementation of this protocol that leverages existing markup for sites that can be represented as lists of items (products, recipes, attractions, reviews, etc.). Along with UI widgets, this allows sites to provide conversational interfaces to their content. See the Life of a chat query documentation for more details on how it works.
