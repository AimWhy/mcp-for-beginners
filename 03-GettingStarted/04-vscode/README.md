# Consuming a server from GitHub Copilot Agent mode

Visual Studio Code and GitHub Copilot can act as a client and consume an MCP Server. Why would we want to do that you might ask? Well, that means whatever features the MCP Server has can now be used from within your IDE. Imagine you adding for example GitHub's MCP server, this would allow for controlling GitHub via prompts over typing specific commands in the terminal. Or imagine anything in general that could improve your developer experience all controlled by natural language. Now you start to see the win right?

## Overview

This lesson covers how to use Visual Studio Code and GitHub Copilot's Agent mode as a client for your MCP Server.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Consume an MCP Server via Visual Studio Code.
- Run capabilities like tools via GitHub Copilot.
- Configure Visual Studio Code to find and manage your MCP Server.

## Approach 

Here's how we need to approach this at high level:

- Configure a file to find our MCP Server.
- Start up/Connect to said server to have it list its capabilities.
- Use said capabilities through GitHub Copilots chat interface.

Great, now that we understand the flow, let's try use an MCP Server through Visual Studio Code through an exercise.

## Exercise: Consuming a server

In this exercise, we will configure Visual Studio Code to find your MCP server so that it can be used from GitHub Copilots chat interface.

### -0- Prestep, enable MCP Server discovery

You may need to enable discovery of MCP Servers.

1. Go to `File -> Preferences -> Settings` in Visual Studio Code.

1. Search for "MCP" and enable `chat.mcp.discovery.enabled` in the settings.json file.

### -1- Create config file

Start by creating a config file in your project root, you will need a file called MCP.json and to place it in a folder called .vscode. It should look like so:

```text
.vscode
|-- mcp.json
```

Next, let's see how we can add a server entry.

### -2- Configure a server

Add the following content to *mcp.json*:

```json
{
    "inputs": [],
    "servers": {
       "hello-mcp": {
           "command": "cmd",
           "args": [
               "/c", "node", "<absolute path>\\build\\index.js"
           ]
       }
    }
}
```

Here's a simple example above how to start a server written in Node.js. 

Let's call out the important parts:

- `input`, you can add input that you want to pass the server. Here's how you can use it:

  ```json
  {
    // ðŸ’¡ Inputs are prompted on first server start, then stored securely by VS Code.
    "inputs": [
      {
        "type": "promptString",
        "id": "perplexity-key",
        "description": "Perplexity API Key",
        "password": true
      }
    ],
    "servers": {
      // https://github.com/ppl-ai/modelcontextprotocol/
      "Perplexity": {
        "type": "stdio",
        "command": "npx",
        "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-perplexity-ask"],
        "env": {
          "PERPLEXITY_API_KEY": "${input:perplexity-key}"
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  This example is from [Visual Studio Code docs])(https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/mcp-servers). But it does show you can set things up so that you're prompted for input by setting `type` to "promptString". In the `servers` element, you can then interpolate the input through `${input:perplexity-key}`. This is a great way to keep secrets out of the code but you're still in need of prompting the user to ensure they can use the server correctly. In this case, the key gets passed as an environment variable.

- `servers`, this holds a number of server entries.
- An entry in `servers` element, an entry typically has a type that's either `stdio` or `sse`. Depending on chosen type, you'll be asked for different properties to go with it. For type "stdio" it needs a `command` and `args` that together should start up the server, so for example `command` and `["/c", "node", "<absolute path>\\build\\index.js"]`. For "sse", you instead need to specify a `url` to where your running server lives, let's look at that in the next chapter.

Now that we have a good understanding, let's start the server next:

### -3- Start the server

Now that you've added an entry, let's start the server:

1. Locate your entry in *mcp.json* and make sure you find the "play" icon:

  ![Starting server in Visual Studio Code](./assets/vscode-start-server.png)  

1. Click the "play" icon, you should see the tools icon in the GitHun Copilot chat increase the number of available tools. If you click said tools icon, you will see a list of registered tools. You can check/uncheck each tool depending if you want GitHub Copilot to use them as context: 

  ![Starting server in Visual Studio Code](./assets/vscode-tool.png)

1. Ton run a tool, type a prompt that you know will match the description of one of your tools, for example a prompt like so "add 22 to 1":

  ![Running a tool from GitHub Copilot](./assets/vscode-agent.png)

  You should see a response saying 23.

## Assignment

Try adding a server entry to you *mcp.json* file and make sure you can start/stop the server. Make sure you can also communicate with the tools on your server via GitHub Copilots chat interface.

## Solution

No solution provided.

## Key Takeaways

The takeaways from this chapter is the following:

- Visual Studio Code is a great client that lets you consume several MCP Servers and their tools.
- GitHub Copilots chat interface is how you interact with the servers.
- You can prompt the user for inputs like API keys that can be passed to the MCP Server when configuring the server entry in *mcp.json* file.
