# MCP Security Best Practices - July 2025 Update

## Comprehensive Security Best Practices for MCP Implementations

When working with MCP servers, follow these security best practices to protect your data, infrastructure, and users:

1. **Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize inputs to prevent injection attacks and confused deputy problems.
   - Implement strict validation for all tool parameters
   - Use schema validation to ensure requests conform to expected formats
   - Filter potentially malicious content before processing

2. **Access Control**: Implement proper authentication and authorization for your MCP server with fine-grained permissions.
   - Use OAuth 2.0 with established identity providers like Microsoft Entra ID
   - Implement role-based access control (RBAC) for MCP tools
   - Never implement custom authentication when established solutions exist

3. **Secure Communication**: Use HTTPS/TLS for all communications with your MCP server and consider adding additional encryption for sensitive data.
   - Configure TLS 1.3 where possible
   - Implement certificate pinning for critical connections
   - Regularly rotate certificates and verify their validity

4. **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse, DoS attacks, and to manage resource consumption.
   - Set appropriate request limits based on expected usage patterns
   - Implement graduated responses to excessive requests
   - Consider user-specific rate limits based on authentication status

5. **Logging and Monitoring**: Monitor your MCP server for suspicious activity and implement comprehensive audit trails.
   - Log all authentication attempts and tool invocations
   - Implement real-time alerting for suspicious patterns
   - Ensure logs are securely stored and cannot be tampered with

6. **Secure Storage**: Protect sensitive data and credentials with proper encryption at rest.
   - Use key vaults or secure credential stores for all secrets
   - Implement field-level encryption for sensitive data
   - Regularly rotate encryption keys and credentials

7. **Token Management**: Prevent token passthrough vulnerabilities by validating and sanitizing all model inputs and outputs.
   - Implement token validation based on audience claims
   - Never accept tokens not explicitly issued for your MCP server
   - Implement proper token lifetime management and rotation

8. **Session Management**: Implement secure session handling to prevent session hijacking and fixation attacks.
   - Use secure, non-deterministic session IDs
   - Bind sessions to user-specific information
   - Implement proper session expiration and rotation

9. **Tool Execution Sandboxing**: Run tool executions in isolated environments to prevent lateral movement if compromised.
   - Implement container isolation for tool execution
   - Apply resource limits to prevent resource exhaustion attacks
   - Use separate execution contexts for different security domains

10. **Regular Security Audits**: Conduct periodic security reviews of your MCP implementations and dependencies.
    - Schedule regular penetration testing
    - Use automated scanning tools to detect vulnerabilities
    - Keep dependencies updated to address known security issues

11. **Content Safety Filtering**: Implement content safety filters for both inputs and outputs.
    - Use Azure Content Safety or similar services to detect harmful content
    - Implement prompt shield techniques to prevent prompt injection
    - Scan generated content for potential sensitive data leakage

12. **Supply Chain Security**: Verify the integrity and authenticity of all components in your AI supply chain.
    - Use signed packages and verify signatures
    - Implement software bill of materials (SBOM) analysis
    - Monitor for malicious updates to dependencies

13. **Tool Definition Protection**: Prevent tool poisoning by securing tool definitions and metadata.
    - Validate tool definitions before use
    - Monitor for unexpected changes to tool metadata
    - Implement integrity checks for tool definitions

14. **Dynamic Execution Monitoring**: Monitor runtime behavior of MCP servers and tools.
    - Implement behavioral analysis to detect anomalies
    - Set up alerting for unexpected execution patterns
    - Use runtime application self-protection (RASP) techniques

15. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Ensure MCP servers and tools operate with minimal required permissions.
    - Grant only the specific permissions needed for each operation
    - Regularly review and audit permission usage
    - Implement just-in-time access for administrative functions
